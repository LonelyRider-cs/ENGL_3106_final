#So far, all of what we've done here is stuff we've done before in class and for 
#the sentiment analysis project. Let's try something different.
#Warning: this stuff gets kinda processor intensive, it could crash jupyterhub. I'm
#running this on my local version of RStudio.

#Let's try topic modeling. The tutorial I'm following/adapting is here:
#https://www.tidytextmining.com/topicmodeling.html
#Topic modeling is a method of essentially letting the computer read our data and
#tell us what it sees in it, instead of telling the computer to look for what we
#want to see. In essence, topic modeling reads "documents," like Twitter posts,
#newspaper articles, or in our case, chapters in a novel. Every document is made of
#a set number of topics, and each topic has certain words in it. These topics aren't
#pre-defined, but interpreted on the spot. Running the same topic model on the 
#same data can yield slightly different results when you run it.

#We're using a new package, "topicmodels."
install.packages("topicmodels")
library(topicmodels)
#We've already indexed our text by chapter, let's have a quick look at the most
#common words, indexed by chapter, sorted from most appearances in one chapter to least.
#We start with a basic word count for each chapter.
GOT_chapterWordCounts <- GOT_tibbleClean %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(chapternum, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
#And let's do it for indexes of 200 lines.
GOT_indexedWordCounts <- GOT_tibbleClean %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(index = lineID %/% 200, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
#This word count is going to be the basis for our topic model. Before we can do
#the actual topic modeling, we need to convert our data from a tibble to 
#something called a DocumentTermMatrix, for the topicmodel to be able to read it.
GOT_chaptersDTM <- GOT_chapterWordCounts %>%
  cast_dtm(chapternum, word, n)
#The actual method of topic modeling we're using is called Latent Dirichelet
#Allocation. Do not ask me what that precisely means, I couldn't tell you.
#But let's try it anyway!
GOT_chaptersLDA <- LDA(GOT_chaptersDTM, k = 8, control = list(seed = 1234))
#For the above, k = number of topics to generate. 4 is just our example, 
#Change the seed value for different results! The creation process is the heavy 
#part, especially when working with large corpora. Give it a few seconds.
#Once it's done, let's clean it up and put it back in tibble form.
GOT_topicTerms <- tidy(GOT_chaptersLDA, matrix = "beta")
#One topic per term per row. Note that the topics have numbers. The program doesn't
#necessarily know what unifies these terms under these topics, that's for us to 
#interpret.

#This is only one way of topic modeling or using LDA. The results here are skewed
#and imperfect because of the size of the dataset. Long as it is, AGoT is still
#just one text. Things tend to improve with the size of the dataset used (the whole
#ASoIaF series, or the early modern drama corpus, for example).
